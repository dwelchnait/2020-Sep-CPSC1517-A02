<blockquote>
    Bootstrap is a css style sheet created as open source. It contains about 10,000 lines of css code.
    Using various aspects of this style sheet can allow us to quickly via classes block format our
    web page. It will also allow for text alignment, setting up nicely formatted grid displays,
    create color buttons, banners, etc.
    Alert allows for color blocking an area plus other stuff. 4 basic colors can be obtained
    by using alert-success, alert-info, alert-warning and alert-danger.
    Default block alignment is left. You can change that using text-xxxxxx where xxxxx is 
    left, right or center
    <br/><br/>
    WARNING: Bootstrap is open-source third party and is subject to change. Thus items that were once
    available may NOT be available in the future. For Bootstrap, if you wish to override a class, it
    is best to code your own style and NOT alter the NuGet package of Bootstrap.
